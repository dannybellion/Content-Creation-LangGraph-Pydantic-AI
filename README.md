# Content Creation Pipeline using LangGraph and Pydantic AI

I watched this Greg Isenberg video on effective writing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om-etwwp3Wg&t=6s which inspired me to create a multi-agent workflow to replicate this process.

The high level overview is:


## Technical Implementation

LangGraph is used to orchestrate the workflow.

Pydantic AI is used for the individual agents.

Apify is used to search the web for the most relevant and up to date information.


## How to run

1. Install the dependencies
2. Run the workflow
3. View the results
