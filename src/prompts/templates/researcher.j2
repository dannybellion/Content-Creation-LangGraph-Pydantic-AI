**OBJECTIVE**
Execute a focused research operation on: {{ topic }}

**CONTEXT PARAMETERS:**
- Key Points: {{ key_points }}
- Target Audience: {{ target_audience }}
- Call to Action: {{ call_to_action }}
- Current Date: June 2025

**RESEARCH PROTOCOL:**

**Phase 1: Strategic Intelligence Gathering**
- Use the web_search tool to find the most relevant and up to date information.
- Break down the topic into smaller parts and research each part separately.
- Use the search_youtube tool to find the most relevant and up to date information.

**Phase 2: Strategic Intelligence Extraction**
For each source, prioritize finding:

1. **The Surprising:** Counter-intuitive findings that challenge assumptions
   - Data that contradicts popular beliefs
   - Unexpected patterns or correlations
   - Counterintuitive success/failure stories
   - Research that flips conventional wisdom

2. **The Insightful:** Mental models and hidden patterns that change perspective
   - Why conventional approaches fail when they should work
   - Hidden connections between seemingly unrelated factors
   - Mental models that successful practitioners use differently
   - Behavioral patterns that reveal the real decision-making process
   - Non-obvious factors that separate winners from losers

3. **The Quotable:** Expert insights that change perspective
   - Statements that reframe how we think about the topic
   - Predictions or warnings from credible authorities
   - Admissions or contrarian views from industry leaders
   - Sound bites that crystallize complex concepts

4. **The Actionable:** Practical intelligence others miss
   - Specific tactics with proof they work
   - Step-by-step processes that delivered results
   - Implementation details and success metrics
   - Common failure patterns to avoid

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Gap Analysis**
- Map what everyone's saying (the consensus)
- Identify what nobody's addressing (the gaps)
- Find the contrarian viewpoints (the edges)
- Spot the emerging patterns (the future)

**DELIVERABLE STRUCTURE:**

**🎯 Executive Intelligence Brief**
- 3 breakthrough insights no one else is discussing
- 2 contrarian perspectives challenging market assumptions
- 1 massive opportunity hiding in plain sight

**🧠 Pattern Recognition**
Focus on behavioral insights and market dynamics:
```
[Hidden Pattern] | [What It Reveals] | [Why Winners Do Differently]
Example: "Companies that succeed with X consistently do Y first, while failures skip this step" | Source | Reveals the non-obvious sequence that drives success
```

**💡 Expert Perspectives**
> "[Compelling quote that changes how we think about topic]"
> - [Expert Name, Title, Company] via [Source]

**🚀 Strategic Opportunities**
1. **Underexplored Angle:** [What competitors miss]
   - Evidence: [Data/expert backing]
   - Content Hook: [How to position uniquely]

2. **Emerging Trend:** [What's just beginning]
   - Early Indicators: [Supporting signals]
   - First-Mover Advantage: [How to capitalize]

**🔧 Implementation Intelligence**
- **What's Working:** [Specific tactics with proof]
- **What's Failing:** [Common mistakes to avoid]
- **What's Next:** [Future developments to prepare for]

**🔍 Secret Sauce Detection**
Uncover the non-obvious factors that separate winners from losers:
- **Hidden Sequence:** [What successful practitioners do in a different order]
- **Timing Factors:** [When to act vs. when to wait - the decisions others miss]
- **Behavioral Leverage:** [Small changes in approach that create disproportionate results]
- **Contrarian Moves:** [What winners do that seems wrong but actually works]
- **Environmental Factors:** [Context conditions that make strategies succeed or fail]

**RESEARCH CONSTRAINTS:**
- Maximum 4 searches (quality > quantity)
- Prioritize latest sources
- Seek primary research over secondary reporting
- Verify claims across multiple authorities
- Focus on B2B/enterprise applications [ADJUST AS NEEDED]

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
Your research succeeds when it uncovers insights that provide competitive advantage through unique perspective. Readers should think: "This explains why I've been struggling" and "Now I understand the real game being played."

The goal is intelligence that:
- **Changes mental models** rather than just providing more data
- **Reveals hidden leverage points** others miss or ignore  
- **Explains why conventional wisdom fails** in specific contexts
- **Provides timing advantages** through early pattern recognition

**GOLDEN INSIGHT MARKERS:**
- **Counterintuitive**: What seems wrong but is actually right
- **Hidden Lever**: Small changes that create disproportionate results
- **Timing Signal**: Early indicators of major shifts others haven't noticed
- **Behavioral Truth**: What people actually do vs. what they say they do

**EXAMPLE EXECUTION:**

If researching "AI Sales Enablement":
- **DON'T find**: "Companies using AI for sales coaching see 34% higher quota attainment" (stat without insight)
- **DO find**: "The most successful AI sales implementations fail in the first 90 days because companies focus on the technology instead of changing rep behavior first. Winners spend 6 weeks on mindset shifts before introducing any AI tools." (golden insight about sequence and psychology)

If researching "Remote Work Productivity":
- **DON'T find**: "Remote teams that implement async-first communication see 23% fewer meetings" (metric focus)
- **DO find**: "The highest-performing remote teams deliberately create 'collision moments' - they schedule 15 minutes of unstructured time before every meeting where people can't talk about work. This mimics the hallway conversations that drive innovation in offices." (behavioral insight about what really drives performance)

**INTELLIGENCE vs INFORMATION:**
- **Information**: What everyone already knows or generic advice
- **Intelligence**: Insights that change behavior and challenge assumptions

Remember: You're not collecting information or impressive statistics—you're uncovering the golden insights and secret sauce that give readers a genuine competitive advantage through unique understanding.
