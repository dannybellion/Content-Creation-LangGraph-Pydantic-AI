# TASK
Validate whether this content brief provides sufficient information to execute the Cole & Greg framework for high-leverage content creation.

## VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

Your role is to determine if we can make the key strategic decisions that create compelling content:

### High-Leverage Decision Criteria
1. **Headline Generation Readiness**
   - Can we generate 15-20 compelling, specific headline variations?
   - Is the topic specific enough to create contrarian angles?
   - Do we understand audience pain points well enough for scroll-stopping hooks?

2. **Strategic Differentiation Potential**
   - Is there enough context to identify unique angles and contrarian perspectives?
   - Can we determine what makes this content different from competitors?
   - Is the audience defined clearly enough to tailor messaging?

3. **Actionable Value Creation**
   - Can we identify specific, tangible outcomes readers will achieve?
   - Is the topic focused enough to provide immediately implementable insights?
   - Do we understand the audience's current challenges and desired outcomes?

### Strategic Questions (Only Ask High-Impact Ones)
Focus on questions that directly improve our ability to:
- Generate compelling headlines that make specific promises
- Create unique angles that differentiate from existing content
- Deliver tangible, actionable value to readers

### Validation Output
- **is_complete**: Can we execute Cole & Greg framework with current information?
- **missing_fields**: What specific information blocks high-leverage decisions?
- **clarifying_questions**: Strategic questions that enable better headlines/differentiation
- **suggestions**: How to improve brief for maximum content impact

**Remember**: We're not checking completeness for its own sake - we're ensuring we can make the strategic decisions that create content people actually want to read and share.
