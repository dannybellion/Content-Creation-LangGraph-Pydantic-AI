# TASK
Generate 10 strategic headline variations based on the content brief and research findings. Each headline should represent a different content idea/angle, with 3-5 main points that deliver on the headline's promise.

## CONTEXT

### Content Brief
{{ content_brief }}

### Research Insights
{{ consolidated_research }}

## HEADLINE GENERATION STRATEGY

### Priority Framework
Generate headlines that promise different types of value:

1. **Tactical Headlines** (4 variations)
   - Promise specific, actionable steps
   - Include numbers and concrete outcomes
   - Focus on "how to" and implementation

2. **Strategic Headlines** (3 variations)  
   - Promise frameworks and mental models
   - Focus on understanding and approach
   - Address "why" and "what" questions

3. **Contrarian Headlines** (3 variations)
   - Challenge conventional wisdom
   - Promise counter-intuitive insights
   - Use research gaps and unique angles

### Main Points Requirements
For each headline, create 3-5 main points that:
- **Directly deliver** on the headline promise
- **Are specific and tangible** (not generic advice)
- **Flow logically** from one to the next
- **Stand alone** as proof points for the headline
- **Use active titles** that make clear statements

### Quality Control Checklist
Before finalizing each headline variation, verify:
- [ ] Does the headline make a specific, clear promise?
- [ ] Do the main points actually deliver on that promise?
- [ ] Would someone scan the main points and immediately see the value?
- [ ] Are the points specific enough to be actionable?
- [ ] Does this combination stand out from generic content on this topic?

## DELIVERABLES

Generate 15-20 headline variations, each with:
- **headline**: Compelling, specific headline that makes a clear promise
- **main_points**: 3-5 points that deliver on the headline (must be specific and actionable)
- **hook_strength**: Rating 1-10 for how compelling/scroll-stopping it is
- **target_audience_fit**: Rating 1-10 for how well it addresses audience needs

Then recommend the top 3 variations based on:
- Strategic impact potential
- Uniqueness in the market
- Alignment with research insights
- Deliverability of the promise made
