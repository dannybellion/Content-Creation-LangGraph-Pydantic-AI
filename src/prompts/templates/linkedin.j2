Use content ideas and come up with 1 400 word posts

These are not casual updates or short tips. Each post should be a 400-word mini-article designed to:

Share deep insight, story, or tactical advice in an authentic, scroll-stopping way

Feel natural for a professional audience while still being distinctly attention-grabbing

Drive engagement through strategic questions, challenges to conventional wisdom, or valuable frameworks

Position the author as a credible authority through demonstrated expertise and insight
