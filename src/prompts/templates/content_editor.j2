{{ content_brief }}

### Selected Headline Variation
{{ selected_headline_variation }}

### Research Insights
{{ consolidated_research }}

## EDITORIAL DECISIONS

### 1. Container & Framework Selection
Choose the optimal content container based on:
- **Content goals** (educate, persuade, inspire, guide)
- **Audience preferences** (busy professionals need scannable lists, technical audiences prefer frameworks)
- **Topic complexity** (simple topics work as lists, complex ones need structured frameworks)
- **Engagement patterns** (what keeps this audience reading?)

Available containers: rule_of_three, listicle, how_to_guide, case_study, framework, story_based, comparison, trend_analysis

### 2. Magical Way Selection  
Determine how this content will deliver value:
- **tips**: Actionable recommendations
- **stats**: Data-driven insights  
- **steps**: Sequential process
- **lessons**: Key takeaways
- **examples**: Real-world cases
- **reasons**: Logical arguments
- **stories**: Narrative illustrations
- **quotes**: Expert perspectives
- **resources**: Tools and references
- **frameworks**: Mental models

### 3. Strategic Content Planning

**Priority Ranking (Funnel Mindset):**
Transform the selected headline's main points into 3 prioritized core ideas, ranked by:
1. **Most compelling/surprising** (leads to hook readers)
2. **Most actionable** (provides immediate value)  
3. **Most differentiating** (sets apart from competitors)

**For each prioritized idea:**
- Create an **active, compelling section title** (not generic headings)
- Write **1000 words of background context** to add depth and color
- Identify **supporting research points** that strengthen the argument
- Define **specific value proposition** this section delivers

### 4. Differentiation Strategy
Based on research gaps and unique angles, articulate:
- **What makes this content different** from existing content on this topic
- **Contrarian angle** (if applicable) that challenges conventional wisdom
- **Unique value proposition** readers can't get elsewhere

### 5. Research Integration Strategy
Plan how to weave research naturally into the content:
- **Surprising insights** to highlight (counter-intuitive findings)
- **Specific statistics** to include for credibility
- **Expert quotes** for authority (only if they add real value)
- **Actionable takeaways** readers can implement immediately

### 6. Audience Alignment & Engagement
Design content structure to:
- **Address core pain points** of the target audience
- **Match complexity level** to audience expertise
- **Optimize for scanning** (busy readers need clear structure)
- **Create momentum** through logical progression

### 7. Quality Assurance
Verify that:
- **Subheads deliver** on headline promise (not just related topics)
- **Content is tangible** and actionable (rate 1-10 for specificity)
- **Opening strategy** immediately captures attention and sets expectations
- **Funnel optimization** leads with strongest material
